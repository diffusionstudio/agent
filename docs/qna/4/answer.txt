```javascript
import * as core from '@diffusionstudio/core';

const video = new core.VideoClip(source, {
  position: 'center',
  height: '100%',
  width: '100%',
});
```

Setting height to 100% ensures the video fully covers the composition's height, while position: 'center' aligns it properly. By not setting width to 100%, the video will maintain its original aspect ratio.
