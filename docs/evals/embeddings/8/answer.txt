```javascript
import * as core from '@diffusionstudio/core';

const source = await core.ImageSource.from('https://example.com/image.png');
const image = new core.ImageClip(source, { delay: 30, duration: 150 });

await composition.add(image);
```

This code correctly initializes an ImageClip with a source image, sets its delay and duration, and adds it to the composition.
